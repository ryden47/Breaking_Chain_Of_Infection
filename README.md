# Breaking_Chain_Of_Infection
Breaking the Chain of Covid-19 infection, using C++. Handling with memory leaks.

In this assignment i will help flattening the curve, by writing a C++ program that simulates a
contact tracing system. The program simulates a social network (represented as a graph), in
which an epidemic is spreading, and contact tracers are searching for infected people, trace
their contacts, and attempt to break the chain of infection.
